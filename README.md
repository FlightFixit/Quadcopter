Quadcopter
==========

This is a repo of 3D designed custom Quadcopter parts. They all fit together to make a 3D Printable Quadcopter!

All of the files that are in this repository have been designed and produced solely by Isaac Norris 
and are for the purpose of making well rounded, structuraly sound quadcopter frames. 


If you are interested in quadcopters, or have one, and also have a 3D printer, print it up! fly it around! Have FUN!!!

I recommend, if you are 3d printing it, use ABS Plastic, PLA will work, but i do not recommend it.
